# world-wide-flags

world-wide-flags is a web-application built following a MVC approach, exploiting Java Servlets, JSPs and Java Beans. It has been implemented as an exercise for the Web Architectures Master's Course in CS, whose assignment and report can be found in the folder `docs/`.

The user interface has been first prepared using Figma and then recreated using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
